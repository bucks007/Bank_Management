Bank Management System

Hola Amigo,

this code is based on bank Management System using C++. 
It is a basic program in which user have to create an account and need to deposit amount in his/her account.
After creating account user need to login to perform tasks (like deposit,withdraw,check balance,show transactions etc.) and after ther user can log out their account.

This code includes basics of OOPs, File Handling and also uses some header files like vector,algorithm etc for various purposes
